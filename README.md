# Assistant-360
Project Assistant 360 is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate seamless interactions between users, labours, and administrators. The platform consists of three key modules: user, labour, and admin.

In the user module, individuals seeking assistance for various tasks and services can access the platform. They can browse through a diverse range of labour profiles and their respective skills, availability, and experience. Users can specify their requirements and book labours that best match their needs.

The labour module is specifically designed for skilled workers and professionals to register their profiles. Labours can create detailed profiles, showcasing their expertise, qualifications, and availability. They have the opportunity to present their skills and attract potential users seeking their services.

The admin module plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and quality of the platform. Administrators verify and confirm the labour profiles to ensure that only reliable and qualified labours are available for booking. They also handle any administrative tasks related to the platform, ensuring smooth operations and user satisfaction.
